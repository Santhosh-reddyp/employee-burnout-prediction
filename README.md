Employee Burnout Prediction

Overview

The Employee Burnout Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict employee burnout based on various features such as work hours, job satisfaction, workload, and other relevant factors. By accurately predicting burnout, organizations can take proactive measures to improve employee well-being and productivity.

Project Structure

data/: Contains datasets used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
models/: Saved model files and any related artifacts.
scripts/: Utility scripts for data processing and model deployment.
requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies required for the project.
README.md: This file.
Features

Data Collection: Collection of relevant features from employee surveys and performance metrics.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data into a suitable format for model training.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and selecting features that significantly impact burnout prediction.
Model Training: Training machine learning models to predict burnout levels.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
Deployment: (Optional) Deploying the model for real-time predictions.
